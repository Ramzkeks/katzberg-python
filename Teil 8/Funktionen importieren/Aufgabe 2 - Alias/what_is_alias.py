1. What is an Alias?  
An alias is a shortened name for a module or function. When importing a module or function, we 
can assign it a shorter, alternative name to simplify its use in code.  



2. How Does It Work?  

When you write:
'''  
python
import Alias.al_calculator_functions as calc  
'''
- Python imports the `calculator_functions` module.  
- Instead of typing the full name `calculator_functions` every time, you can use the shorter alias `calc`.  
- `as calc` assigns the alias, which you’ll use in your code instead of the full module name.  

If the module has a function `add`, you can call it like this:
'''  
python
calc.add(5, 3)   
'''
Without an alias, you’d write:
'''
python
al_calculator_functions.add(5, 3)   



'''
3. Why Is This Useful?  
    1. Shorter Code: Replace long module names with concise aliases.  
    2. Readability: Choose aliases that fit the context. For example, `calc` clearly indicates a calculator-related module.  
    3. Consistency: Simplify working with long module names. For instance:  
'''
   python  
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
   '''  
   This shortens the code and improves readability.  
'''

4. Example Without an Alias  

Without an alias, you must use the full module name:  
'''
python  
import Alias.al_calculator_functions as al_calculator_functions  

result = al_calculator_functions.add(5, 3)  
print(result)    



'''
5. Example With an Alias  

With an alias, the code is cleaner:  
'''
python  
import Alias.al_calculator_functions as calc  

result = calc.add(5, 3)  
print(result)  
  


'''
6. Key Point: Aliases Are for Convenience  
Aliases do not change a module’s functionality. They are simply alternative names used within your code.  



7. Summary  

Here’s a quick breakdown:  
- Without an alias: Always use the full module name.  
- **With an alias: Use a short, intuitive name.
